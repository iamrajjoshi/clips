# clips.rajjoshi.me

A static clippings site that collects links, tweets, images, videos, and notes as repo-backed markdown. Built with Astro and deployed to GitHub Pages.

> The `clip` CLI that authors clips is a **separate npm package** — see [The `clip` CLI](#the-clip-cli) below.

## What this is

`clips.rajjoshi.me` is a static clippings site. Each clip is a single markdown file in the repo, rendered by Astro into a feed of cards and individual permalink pages. There is no database, backend, or runtime service — the repo's content collection is the source of truth and Astro generates a static site from it.

The `/inbox` page is a separate browser-local reading queue. It accepts a JSON list of saved links, keeps at most five active reads, and lets you move items among reading, reference, watch, done, and let-go views. Its data lives in that browser's local storage, not in the markdown collection or the generated site. Use **Export JSON backup** before clearing site data or changing browsers; import that file on another device to move your queue. The inbox opens original links for reading and does not sync X or fetch article text.

## Tech Stack

- [Astro 5](https://astro.build) — static pages and content collections
- Native CSS and JavaScript — theme selection and feed search
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) workspaces — package management
- Static output, deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)

## Develop

Requires Node.js and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev server starts the Astro site with hot reload. The web app lives in `apps/web`.

Lint, test, and format:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm format:check
```

## Build

Produce the static site in `apps/web/dist`:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Always run `pnpm build` before shipping changes.

## Content Structure

- Clip markdown files live in `apps/web/src/content/clips/` (one file per clip)
- Clip assets (images, downloaded media) live in `apps/web/public/clips/<slug>/`
- The clip schema and types are defined in `apps/web/src/content/schema.ts`
- The Astro content collection is registered in `apps/web/src/content/config.ts`
- Card rendering components live in `apps/web/src/components/cards/`

Clip kinds: `link`, `tweet`, `image`, `video`, `note`. One markdown file per clip; assets live in `apps/web/public/clips/<slug>/`.

## Deployment

The site is deployed with GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

- GitHub Actions builds `apps/web` and deploys `apps/web/dist` to Pages
- Set the custom domain to `clips.rajjoshi.me` in the repository's **Settings → Pages** or through the Pages API
- Keep `apps/web/public/CNAME` set to `clips.rajjoshi.me`; GitHub ignores this file for Actions deployments, so it doesn't configure the Pages custom domain
- DNS should point `clips.rajjoshi.me` at `iamrajjoshi.github.io`

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and [`runbooks/README.md`](runbooks/README.md) for system flow and deployment recovery.

## The `clip` CLI

The CLI that authors clips is a separate project, published as the `cliplink` npm package and developed in [iamrajjoshi/cliplink](https://github.com/iamrajjoshi/cliplink).

Install it globally to publish clips into this repository:

```bash
npm install -g cliplink
```

For CLI documentation — authentication, configuration, `clip init`, remote and local publishing modes, and the full command and flag reference — see the [cliplink repository](https://github.com/iamrajjoshi/cliplink).
